ABOUT
-----

Caustics can be described as the light pattern you see at the bottom of a pool
on a sunny day. This tool will let you render such caustic light patterns. The
rendered images can be animated and are tileable in both space and time.
The rendered images can be used for both realtime applications, such as computer
games, and for non realtime uses such as movie productions and illustrations.
